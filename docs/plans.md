title: Next Steps for OPAL

# Incrementalism

The goal is to work without a fixed fitness function when searching for solutions.
That is, we should propose solutions and ask the user for feedback to refine them.
Computationally, this means we need to efficiently support re-computation when the user makes adjustments.

# Stuff I'm Not Working On Right Now

## Global Search Algorithms

We need to think about expressing more sophisticated search algorithms.
